# odin-recipes
This website will consist of a main index page that will serve as a sort of "menu" that will have multiple redirect links to a couple of recipes.
Once I will finish this project, I will have proved that I have a good understanding of how basic HTML tags work and how well I can upgrade the basic boilerplate, 
into a functional and not-so-good-looking website.
